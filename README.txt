This repository contains code implement the two-step Kappa approach written by O'Shea, Nathan, Sharma and Wasko, currently under review for publication in Water Resources Research

The code is written in the R programming language. 

There are four scripts:
1) Example Script - a script which performs a simplified version of the stochastic experiment used to produce Figure 4d in our paper, comparing the two-step Kappa to the two-step GEV
2) Stochastic_AM - a script which contains functions to estimate stochastic rainfall extremes for the purposes of the stochastic experiment 
3) One_step_Kappa_Nelder_Mead - a script which contains function to calibrate a one-step Kappa
4) Two_step_Kappa_Nelder_Mead - a script which contains functions to calibration the two-step Kappa approach

Nonstationary two-step Kappa - 17/11/2024
 
In November 2024 a second Water Resources Research publication was released. Code was added to implement the two-step Kappa with non-stationary parameters.
Oâ€™Shea, D., Nathan, R., Wasko, C., & Sharma, A. (2024). Separating storm intensity and arrival frequency in nonstationary rainfall frequency analysis. Water Resources Research, 60(11), e2023WR036165.

Code used to fit non-stationary two-step Kappa will be uploaded shortly to the /nonstationary subfolder.

Email declano@unimelb.edu.au or declan.oshea@harc.com.au for access to this code in the meantime.
