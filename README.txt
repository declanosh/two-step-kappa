This repository contains code implement the two-step Kappa approach written by O'Shea, Nathan, Sharma and Wasko, currently under review for publication in Water Resources Research

The code is written in the R programming language. 

There are four scripts:
1) Example Script - a script which performs a simplified version of the stochastic experiment used to produce Figure 4d in our paper, comparing the two-step Kappa to the two-step GEV
2) Stochastic_AM - a script which contains functions to estimate stochastic rainfall extremes for the purposes of the stochastic experiment 
3) One_step_Kappa_Nelder_Mead - a script which contains function to calibrate a one-step Kappa
4) Two_step_Kappa_Nelder_Mead - a script which contains functions to calibration the two-step Kappa approach
